# My First Project

Hello! My name is Carlos and this is my first project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

## Brief description

I made a simple Homepage with code that i learned in course lessons. In future, i would love to create art webpages (for example, 
a page of Goya's bio, a page whose content is about music covers...). 

## Code Used

        The HTML file has a regular HTML boilerplate. I put <a href> list on the top of file in order to get from 
        any page to another.
                >The following <p> and sections are simple text with "Lorem ipsum" method.
                >I included one list, one table, one image section...
                >Below that, there is a part with <div> composed by buttons and grid, both of them created with Bootstrap 4 lenguage. 
                >At the bottom -in this HTML archive- i put a <div> to show some text with SCSS properties.
         
        The CSS contains the styles of some of the HTML document and besides i included SCSS files in order to improve the potencial
        of my CSS properties.
